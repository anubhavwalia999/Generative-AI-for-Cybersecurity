# Generative-AI-for-Cybersecurity

**Tools:** ChatGPT, Python, Network Logs, Malware Analysis

## Project Overview

This project simulated a cybersecurity incident at a fictional nuclear power organization. The goal was to investigate and respond to a sophisticated phishing and malware attack using generative AI technologies.

## Summary

**Situation:**  
Tasked with securing a simulated nuclear power organization from cyber threats.

**Task:**  
Investigate and respond to phishing, malware, and network-based attacks using generative AI.

**Action:**  
- Engineered ChatGPT prompts to detect and assess phishing emails.  
- Analyzed obfuscated Python malware code to uncover intent and impact.  
- Examined network logs to trace compromised endpoints and malicious IPs.  
- Composed an incident report detailing attack vectors and breach timeline.  
- Developed an AI-driven playbook for phishing and malware detection, response, and prevention.

**Result:**  
Demonstrated the effectiveness of LLMs in cybersecurity incident handling and threat intelligence.
